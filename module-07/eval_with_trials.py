"""Demonstrates LLM nondeterminism using trial_count.

Runs the same polite vs. concise eval as Module 6, but with trial_count=3.
Each input is evaluated three times and scores are averaged, giving a more
stable measurement than a single run.

Compare the results to module_6_polite_persona and module_6_concise_persona
to see how trial averaging reduces variance.
