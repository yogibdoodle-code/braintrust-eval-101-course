"""Generate 250 customer support conversations and log them to Braintrust.

Braintrust Topics requires at least 200 traces to generate topic clusters.
This script creates 250 unique conversations across 5 task areas (50 per task)
with a mix of single-turn (~50%) and multi-turn (~50%, 2-5 turns). Messages
vary in sentiment (angry, confused, grateful, panicked, sarcastic, neutral) and
include recurring issue patterns (app bugs, billing errors, quality defects,
communication failures, policy confusion) so that Topics can surface meaningful
clusters.

Braintrust Topics provides three built-in topic maps:

- Task: Classifies traces by the user's intent or goal. Clusters found:
    - Account access and billing issues (44.7%, 88 items)
    - Product specifications and fit questions (33%, 65 items)
    - Delivery and shipping concerns (22.3%, 44 items)

- Sentiment: Classifies traces by the user's emotional tone. Clusters found:
    - Frustration with service issues (61%, 105 items)
    - Mixed emotions with engagement (20.9%, 36 items)
    - Cooperative satisfaction (18%, 31 items)

- Issues: Identifies recurring problems or friction points across traces.
    No clusters generated for this dataset.
